**EDITED FROM ORIGINAL TO FULFILL RUBRIC REQUIREMENTS

Edits include:

* The user homepage instead displays a portion of the question and a link to view more details. 
* When 'More Details' of a question is clicked, the app redirects you to 'question/:id' where all the question details are displayed.

### User Homepage

Once the user is authenticated, the user will be able to toggle between the user's unanswered question and answered questions on his or her homepage, which is located at the root. The unanswered questions are shown by default.

To provide clarity, the chosen user's avatar will always be displayed in the nav bar. 

For unanswered questions, the user will be able to see who asked the question, the question, and the two options to choose from. 

For answered questions, the user will be able to see the question, the two options, the number of people who voted for that option, and what the user has chosen.

### New Question

The user will also have the ability to ask his or her own questions. After clicking on 'New Question,' the application should show a form with the text 'Would You Rather' and inputs for creating the two options. Upon submitting the form, a new poll should be created, the user will be redirected to the user home page, and the new polling question should appear in the correct category on teh home page.

### Leaderboard

To bring in some healthy competition, the application contains a leaderboard that available via the /leaderboard route. Each user contains the user's name, user's avatar, number of questions asked, number of questions the user answered, and the total score.

Users are in order of descending order based on the sum of questions asked and questions answered. The more questions the user asks and answers, the higher up the user moves.
